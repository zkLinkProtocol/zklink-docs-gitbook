{% hint style="info" %}
`proxy withdraw` applies to accounts that can not generate pubkeyhash. For example, a user mistakenly transfers tokens to a smart contract address that does not support pubkeyhash generation. To withdraw the token from Layer2 to Layer1 in such a case, a third-party proxy is required to send the withdrawal request. Noted that the to\_address must be THE smart contract address.
{% endhint %}

## Forced Withdraw
### Function name
#### requestFullExit
Through the **requestFullExit** interface of the **zklink-X L1 contract**, users can withdraw the balance of any token from a specific sub-account on L2, and the funds will be withdrawn to the user's L1 address.
Forced Withdraw is a type of withdrawal operation, and it is the only withdrawal operation initiated by L1. The other two operations are withdrawals of L2.


**_Note_**: The accountId passed in must be the Account ID obtained by the caller msg.sender when registered on zklink-X L2.
By using the **[getAccount](../developer/api-and-sdk/json-rpc/json-rpc-api.md#getaccount)** and the **[getSupportTokens](../developer/api-and-sdk/json-rpc/json-rpc-api.md#getSupportTokens)** and the **[getAccountBalances](../developer/api-and-sdk/json-rpc/json-rpc-api.md#getaccountbalances)** three json-rpc interfaces of the zklink-x layer 2 service, you can find the Account_id corresponding to a given address and the token_id for tokens with a balance.

#### Principle Design
The FullExit instruction is an L1 priority instruction,
requiring zklink-X L2 to execute all L1 instructions in the exact order received from L1.
After L2 completes each L1 instruction and submits the zero-knowledge proof to the chain,
the zklink-X L1 contract will check the order and existence of each submitted priority instruction.
Any erroneous order or instruction will result in a rejection of L2's submission (commitBlocks) until it is corrected.
(In fact, there is a timeout set;
If there is no correct submission for too long, it will enter the **Dunkirk Exit** phase:
The [open-source reps](#https://github.com/zkLinkProtocol/recover_state_server) allowing users to submit proofs to withdraw their own funds.)

ExodusMode is true to indicate that ZkLink is in the exit state. In this state, the user is not allowed to perform FullExit.

#### Example
```
const { ethers } = require('ethers');
const contractABI = [
    {
        "inputs": [
            { "internalType": "uint32", "name": "_accountId", "type": "uint32" },
            { "internalType": "uint8", "name": "_subAccountId", "type": "uint8" },
            { "internalType": "uint16", "name": "_tokenId", "type": "uint16" },
            { "internalType": "bool", "name": "_mapping", "type": "bool" }
        ],
        "name": "requestFullExit",
        "outputs": [],
        "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
        "type": "function"
    }
];

const contractAddress = '0xzklinkXContractAddressHere';
const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, wallet);

async function callRequestFullExit(accountId, subAccountId, tokenId, mapping) {
    try {
        const tx = await contract.requestFullExit(accountId, subAccountId, tokenId, mapping);

        const receipt = await tx.wait();

        console.log('Transaction successful:', receipt);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error calling requestFullExit:', error);
    }
}

callRequestFullExit(10, 1, 100, true);
```

## Fast Withdraw

> ðŸ’¡ **Fast Withdraw** is not a Layer2 function, but a supplementary feature to Layer2 withdraw function.

zkLink verify contract supports Brokers to prepay the withdrawal to users as a substitute to regular withdraws, only if the user agrees to pay the broker fee.

The record of prepayment information is stored in Layer1 smart contracts. When a withdrawal is zk\_verified on-chain, the according prepayment record will be checked in `accepts`; if it is included, the to\_address will be replaced with the broker address.

{% hint style="info" %}
* The serial execution of the broker logic defined in the smart contract makes sure that: 1. multiple brokers cannot take the same fast withdraw request simultaneously; 2. a single request cannot be approved multiple times.
* The broker records are stored in the contract. Once the prepayment is successfully executed, the broker will definitely receive the prepaid principal.
{% endhint %}

```
/// @dev Accept infos of fast withdraw of account
/// uint32 is the account id
/// byte32 is keccak256(abi.encodePacked(receiver, tokenId, amount, withdrawFeeRate, nonce))
/// address is the accepter
mapping(uint32 => mapping(bytes32 => address)) public accepts;

/// @dev Broker allowance used in accept, accepter can authorize broker to do accept
/// @dev Similar to the allowance of transfer in ERC20
/// @dev The struct of this map is (tokenId => accepter => broker => allowance)
mapping(uint16 => mapping(address => mapping(address => uint128))) internal brokerAllowances;
